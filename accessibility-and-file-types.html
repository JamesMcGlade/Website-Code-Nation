                        <h1>Web accesibility</h1>

                        Now when building our web page we have to take in consideration that our site needs to be accesible to the user. Web accessibility lets people with cognitive difficulties gain access to online content.
                        <br>There are several factors to keep in mind that will accomplish a succesful accessible website.
                        <ul>

                            <li>Whether people have a disability or not, if a site has not been properly designed to allow for simple navigation, some of the website’s information will be difficult to access.
                            <br>There are two main elements that relate to navigation which are tab-through order, meaning that the website can be navigated using just the keyboard and landmarks in order to provide navigation indicators</li>

                            <li>If a website has been properly stuctured the user can identify, even if they have any kind of vision impairment and in need of a screen reader, the logical connection between the different sections of the webpage.
                            <br> unique titles (where no two page share the same title), or logical progressions of headings, or even simple measures of correct indentation when making a list are great examples of good webpage structure.</li>

                            <li>Developing web pages that allow for flexibility in the way text is displayed provides users with a wide range of simple options that can significantly improve how easy it is to read a site’s text. Being able to modify a text´s size, contrast and color could improve greatly a website's accessibility.</li>

                            <li>Using images rather than text to convey meaning or to navigate webpages prevents people from being able to properly access information.</li>

                            <li>Hyperlinks are one of the main features of websites, allowing people to easily navigate to other pages to seek out additional details of related information. To be accessible they need to have clarity (as to where the link leads), readability (to be understood) and distinctivess (underlined to distinguish them from standard text)</li>

                            <li><i>"There are many ways in which the accessibility of multimedia content can be improved. In this area, software and machine-learning technologies are rapidly improving to provide efficient and automatic services such as auto captioning."</i> <a href="https://www.boia.org/blog/the-most-common-web-accessibility-issues-to-avoid" target="_blank">[1]</a></li></ul>

                        These are the main factors to be considered when building a webpage in order to make it accesible. But there are many others, as technology is improving so fast that new ways of delivering accessibility are being created quite frecuently. This is the proper way to make internet available for all.

                        <h1>Most common files for websites</h1>

                        There are so many files you can encounter on websites they are beyond counting. Here are the most used files you can find online sorted by their functions:
                        <br><h3>Audio and video</h3>

                        <ul>
                            <li><b>AVI — Audio/Video Interleaved</b>
                            <p>Standard video format supported on the windows platform. They do not stream, however, so you have to download the entire file before you can watch any of it.
                            <br>Use » Windows Media Player or pick up WinAmp or QuickTime.</p></li>

                            <li><b>.MIDI/ .MID — Musical Instrument Digital Interface</b>
                            <p>Midis are sequenced music files made on keyboards. They’re usually really small and often sound great, although it largely depends on your soundcard. Midi collections are one of the few places in the world where you can find classic game and movie music, and for that I salute them.
                            <br>I use » WinAmp.</p></li>

                            <li><b>.MP3 — MPEG Layer 3 sound file</b>
                            <p>Singlehandedly caused a revolution. MP3 is a sound file format which is highly compressed, which allows download-happy filesizes and excellent quality. Has caused much grief for the music industry as songs are now small enough to be traded online.
                            <br>Get the superb » WinAmp for the best player around.</li>

                            <li><b>.MPEG/ .MPG — Motion Picture Experts Group file</b>
                            <p>One of the standards for streaming movies.
                            <br>» WinAmp can play movies. Or you could use » Windows Media Player, by Microsoft.</p></li>

                            <li><b>.MOV/ .QT — QuickTime MOVie</b>
                            <p>The QuickTime format was designed by Apple and originated on the Mac, but has made the transition to the PC and is hugely popular.
                            <br>Get the » QuickTime Player for all your moving picture needs.</p></li>


                            <li><b>.WAV — WAVe sound file</b>
                            <p>A basic, either un- or not very- compressed sound file, usually used for short sound samples.
                            <br>Your computer will be able to play these anyway (when it turns on and sings it’s playing a .wav). Get » WinAmp for more power.</p></li></ul>
                        <h3>Images</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li><b>.JPG/ .JPEG — Joint Photographic Experts Group file</b>
                            <p>Another very common image file format, mainly used for photos.
                            Your browser can show them, or an image editor.</p></li>

                            <li><b>.GIF — Graphics Interchange Format</b>
                            <p>The most common image format on the Internet. Good for simple images.
                            Your browser can display them, or any image editor.</p></li>

                            <li><b>.PNG — Portable Network Graphics</b>
                            <p>PNGs are a file format designed to be used in place of GIFs. They are usually slightly smaller, and sport advanced features like alpha-channel transparency and 24-bit colour support.</p></li></ul>

                        <h3>Other common files</h3>

                        <ul>
                            <li><b>.CSS — Cascading StyleSheet</b>
                            <p>CSS files are a tool in the repertoire of webmasters that take care of how their websites look.
                            <br>CSS files can be created or edited in any text-editor, like Notepad. Try » Visual Studio Code too, it includes loads of selectors for easy editing.</p><li>

                            <b><li>.DOC — Microsoft Word DOCument</b>
                            <p>Microsoft Word is the most popular word processing software in the world. You probably won’t come across loads of doc files, but if you do it can be annoying if you haven’t got a program that can open them.
                            <br>Buy the hideously expensive » Microsoft Word, or just hope that it came with your computer. You can get a “Word viewer” from Microsoft too, which is free. If both of these go against your religion, you could use the free » Open Office suite, which is pretty damn good.
                            </p>></li>
                            <li><b>.EXE — EXEcutable file</b>
                            <p>If you download a program that you need to install, it will likely come as an exe file.
                            <br>Just double click it to install on your PC. Be careful of viruses!</p><li>



                            <li><b>.HTML/ .HTM — HyperText Markup Language file</b>
                            <p>Most pages you create for a website will be HTML files — What is HTML?
                            <br>You’re reading one right now. Sorted.</p></li>



                            <li> <b>.PDF — Portable Document Format</b>
                            <p>Adobe Acrobat files were invented so that documents could be transferred between computers and indeed platforms, and still look the exact same, something which can’t be said about HTML files...
                            <br>Get the » Acrobat Reader to make sense of these things.</p></li>


                            <li><b>.RAR — RAR archive</b>
                            <p>This is a compressed file format similar to the popular .zip format. It sports advanced functions like special multimedia compression and has many benefits over zip files.
                            <br>Get the excellent » WinRAR to take care of your RAR archives, and it can handle other archive types too.</p></li>

                            <li><b>.TXT — TeXT file</b>
                            <p>The most basic of files, it’s just some text.
                            <br>You no doubt already have either NotePad, SimpleText, or your browser, which you definitely have.</p></li>


                            <li><b>.ZIP — ZIPped file</b>
                            <p>Zipped files are really groups of other types of files kept together and compressed a bit. Many downloads will consist of zip collections, so be sure to have something to open them with.
                            <br>» WinZip is the best shareware program for unzipping files and making your own zips.</p></li></ul>
