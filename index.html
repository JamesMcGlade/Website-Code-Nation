                    <h3>About me!</h3>
                    Hi! I'm James! I thought it was convenient to introduce myself so you could know me better!
                    <br><br>I was born and raised in Spain, but my father is Scottish so I had the good fortune to have both a Spanish and a Scottish family, and the possibility to visit the UK and keep in touch with my father's side of the family despite the distance.
                    <br>I have been around computers since I was very young. I got interested in video and photo editing when I was a teenager, learning how to use different editing programs: video, (Windows Movie Maker, Sony vegas and Wondershare Filmora), image (Photoshop) and audio (Audacity).  Now I enjoy my free time with my own Youtube channel, where I upload most of my gameplays and vlogs and edit my own videos. I've recently achieved the astonishing subscriber count of 4k subscribers.
                    <p>My professional background however was not involved in anyway with programming or IT whatsoever. I started a career on law back in Spain and during my last year a dear frind of mine started a career as a programmer in a local company. That's when I first got in touch with the world of coding and programming as a professional option.
                    <br>So I started my law dissertation on IT copyright, and in order to gain deeper knowledge about the subject, I started looking into coding and software developer skills until suddenly I realized that this was what I wanted for my future.
                    <br>But it wasn't until I joined the three week course at Code Nation when I started to see the tip of the iceberg of the potential that a deep understanding on coding and IT functionality can bring into a business. Funny enough I really enjoyed programming with Python and I was really driven to learn while I worked with my team to create a game using code. <br>Thanks to Code Nation I've learned not only a new set of skills but also discovered a new passion (that has already kept me awake at night, by the way). And is this passion that will prompt me to always go an extra mile, whether is to get a job done or to continue learning.</p> 
                    
                    <p>I know this is what I want for my future.</p>
