        <div class="box box1"> <h1>IT in modern business<br></h1>
            <p>In a world where nowadays almost anyone can access to a huge variety of posibilities like checking directions, buying items online, sharing information with other people across the internet... it's only logical for companies to take advantage of information technology in order to thrive in their field. <br>
                There are so many applications for IT in a modern business,  not only client oriented, but also within a company's own management that is almost mandatory to invest in this field just to be relevant.
            </p>
            IT can help a business to:
                <ul>
                <li><b>Improve Inner Communication and Management.</b> Having a quick way to share information within the company will save a lot of time and resources when it comes to decision making, delegating tasks, and providing better eficiency when carrying out different tasks.</li>
                <li><b>Deliver the best possible outcome when delivering a product or a service to the customer.</b> With the posibility at hand to customize the marketing of a product, getting information on it's the demand and providing a better accesibility to the customer matters a great deal, and may lead to a better, more defined decision making. <a href=" https://bizfluent.com/facts-5977213-role-information-technology-business.html" target="_blank">[1]</a> </li>
                <li><b>Have protection against fraud, information leak, vandalism and mala praxis.</b> It's essential for a company to keep their best interests as a high priority when investing in IT, so not only they can be more efficient, but also to keep any information that may put at risk the business or their customers falling into the wrong hands. <a href="https://www.symquest.com/cyber-security-for-business/" target="_blank">[2]</a></li>

        <div class="box box2"><h1> Describing methods, skills and resources needed to complete digital projects</h1>
            When undertaking a new project, whether is digital related or not it's always necessary to have a defined planification in order to achieve the best posible outcome. In order to do that first there has to be an understanding of the task at hand. That means knowing what the client expects from the product and how will that product satisfy it's needs.<br>
            In order to do that the team in charge of developing the product has to be properly managed. Every member should be involved in every part of the process, from the begining, during development and when delivering the final product. A proper task delegation along with a well thought out plan could go a long way. <a href="https://scaffold.digital/top-10-tips-to-digital-project-management/" target="_blank">[1]</a><br>
            Luckily when it comes to planning there is a huge amount of different tools that can make project management much easier and clear, so any of the members involved in the development of the product can see the whole process and understand in which state of development the product currently is. Tools like:
        
            <ul>
                <li><b><a href="https://trello.com" target="_blank">Trello</a></b> (built on the Japanese management "kanban" principle, which involves consistent monitoring of all production phases. It is a great tool for standard projects and is convenient for both command directives and individual assignments. The interface consists of different boards, which represent projects or processes in the company. Each board consists of lists of tasks, cards with descriptions, comments, files, color tags and deadlines. The menu can be displayed as a calendar. The basic functionality of Trello is free and allows you to work with almost no restrictions)</li>
        
                <li><b><a href="https://evernote.com/" target="_blank">Evernote</a></b>, (It can be used to create to-do lists and store all kinds of information about your projects in files)</li>
        
                <li>or <b><a href="https://slack.com/" target="_blank">Slack</a></b> (a web-service, and application  available for desktop, iOS and Android that helps individuals or groups to interact with colleagues or customers on any issues concerning projects. This is a simple application with a very simple and intuitive user interface. You can create a profile, send files, and send and read messages. Private groups are called "channels" and the messages sent within the channel are visible only to the participants of that particular channel. Slack supports more than 100 web services, including the popular Dropbox, Twitter, Google Docs and even Trello, mentioned above. You can use Slack to integrate any of these services and get notifications when there are any changes and activities)</li>
                </ul><p>among others are really useful when working in a project with a team. <a href="https://www.stakeholdermap.com/project-management/10-useful-project-management-tools.html" target="_blank">[2]</a></p>
        
            But planning is just a part of the process. Each member of a team who is involved in a digital project should have at least a common knowledge in certain areas such as: 
            <ul>
                <li><b>Coding</b>: which is key in almost any product developing that includes any kind of IT implications. From HTML and CSS for web developing, to Python (Python is an object-oriented programming language—a type of coding language that lets developers build sites and apps with virtual building blocks ) and JavaScript (JavaScript is a scripting language used to create and control dynamic website content) it's just such a vital part of any project that it cannot be easily discarded.</li>
        
                <li><b>Social media</b>: any business needs to have at least a minimum knowledge on social media platforms in order to keep in touch with the client, or use them for publicity. </li>
        
                <li><b>Teamwork</b>: There is no 'I' in team, so any groupal project needs it's members to work along and be supportive whenever it's needed. Having a good group dynamic with proper comunication it's key.

            </ul>
        </div>

    <div class="box box3"><h1>Creating a website</h1>

        <p>We already covered what it takes to carry out a succesful product. Good planning and everything it implies lays the perfect ground for carrying out almost any task.
        </p>So taking in consideration what we discussed in the case we wanted to, for instance, create our own website we would need to plan ahead the execution of the task. We have many options at our disposal, but in our case we could use Trello. Dividing a task into smaller tasks it's the best way to approach projects, and Trello is a tool that would let us do just that. Specially if we are working with a team, labour distribution makes the creation process easier, and with Trello we could see the actual state of each of the different tasks needed to accomplish the goal.
        <p>First you should choose a platform for your website. The most popular one is WordPress. First of all it's because it's free. Secondly it's easy to use, flexible enough to adapt to any kind of user; but you can choose any other platform if you wish so, it's just that WordPress is the most accesible.
        </p>To set up your website you will need:
        <ul> 
            <li><b>A Domain Name</b> (web address like: thisismywebpage.com)</li>
            <li><b>A web host</b>: a service that connects your site to the internet. Without a web host your webpage won't exist.</li>
            Although one could start coding a website from scratch this is not recommendable because it takes way too much time.
            </ul>

    <p>So once you have a domain name for your website and a host you can begin the construction of your website. This is when you have to start planning how are you going to divide your tasks one by one to have a cleaner process going. If you are working together with a team to build a website even better! A member of the team could be focused on finding the best themes for the website, while another member (or several) can start working on it's content, like adding pages, editing the content that's going to be shown in the page, creating a function for posts if the webpage has a blog section, while another can start working on the custimization of the webpage (either creating it's own thumbnails, the titles for each page within the webpage...)
    </p>Depending on the webhost there is a lot of possibilities for customizing your website, and in order to not lose track of what needs to be done first, you can use Trello as we have referenced before, to layout the different task that need to be carried out in an orderly manner. <a href="https://websitesetup.org/" target="_blank">[1]</a>

    <div class="box box4">
<h1>What causes digital projects to fail? Why?</h1>

<p>We have already discussed about what makes digital projects to succeed, what tools can help to carry out the project and what skills are usually needed in order to face certain complications during the development phase.</p> So when we ask ourselves what makes digital projects to fail, we can get to the conclusion that:

<ul>
 <li>Even though it's a digital project first and foremost it's a business initiative, so it's very likely that without a well thought out business management plan that can adjust the digital scope towards it's actual goal, the project is destined to bump into many unexpected inconvenients and fail eventually. Also good project planification can help to intervene in the case the project gets stuck in a certain part of the development process, making so that tweaks or alternative solutions may be reached to keep it running.</li>
 <li>Lack of communication between company departments. Over the last sections we talked about how communication it's vital to make a project run. This becomes even more important when the project requieres several departments to work together or depending on one another. You can picture it as: the digital part of the process is the channel from which the idea of the project is carried out.</li>
</ul>
These are common problems that an inadquate undestanding of business process may cause, so having a flexible project that can react to problems and a broad scope of all the perspectives that have to be considered can help avoid total disaster. <a href="https://www.celerity.com/5-reasons-digital-projects-fail-the-forgotten-role-of-business-process/" target="_blank">[1]</a>
</div>

<div class="box box5"><h1>Selecting the right kind of technology for the job</h1>    

So now it comes to the point where, once we have defined how to plan ahead a nice proceding to carry out our project, chosen the tools that can help us out when dividing tasks, and we have the fundamental skills (either individual or within a team) needed to make it happen it's time to decide how we should carry out our project depending on the task at hand.
<br>So when it comes to deciding the adecuate technology that would better fit, some people tend to either be subjective  (own personal experience, referrals) or uninformed (a similar project has been carried out in a certain manner that in some cases may not fit the one they are working on).
<p>When approaching this question you need to be realistic and objective about your project. You need to determine the size and type of the project and it's complexity. When it comes to it, usually IT projects are divided into three groups
</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Simple:</b> (business sites, small online stores) where the complexity it's not vert high and most of the functions are already implemented in the platform that provides the web service. Obviously, this comes with huge restrictions on their functionality and appearance.</li>

<li><b>Medium:</b> (larger online stores, national-scale portals...) such projects are usually built around frameworks, which are a functional block with predefined features, which increases the speed rate of the project but will probably come with some limitations when it comes to implementing features, but it will always be cheaper than using a High Level programing code.</li>

<li><b>Large:</b> such as social networks,  where the project's core is developed in a high level (HL) programming language and the need for functionality, flexibility and data exchange are at the highest level. <a href="https://magora-systems.com/how-choose-technology-for-it-project/ " target="_blank">[1]</a></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="box box6"><h1>How my chosen tools have helped me out to carry out my projects</h1>
So depending not only on the scale of the project but also the features you want to implement into it you can then identify how to tackle your project.

<p>When it comes to my personal experience using different tools when carrying out task, wether it's working on my own or as a part of a team I have discovered that planning and communication are indispensable.</p>
<ul>
<li>Trello has helped me a great deal when it comes to planning and dividing the different tasks that I have to carry out when working on a project. It's easy to use, it's versatile, customizable, the interface is user friendly and IT'S FREE! Trello applies what is usually called "Kanban methodology", which focuses on improving the processes of getting work done while boosting quality and productivity.<a href="https://blog.hubstaff.com/kanban-with-trello/" target="_blank">[1]</a>
<br>Overall it's a great app that you can even access from your smartphone. I have used it as a way to organise myself and divide a draft into smaller simpler tasks. You can check out my <a href="https://trello.com/b/YoPaMKz5/assignment" target="_blank">Trello board</a> here!
<br><!-- <img src="Trello.png" alt="img1ref">
<img src="ref_2_trello.jpg" alt="img2ref"> -->
<a href="C:\Users\traff\Documents\website\Trello.png" target="_blank">This</a> is the layout of my current project. See how I divided the different sections of my assignment into smaller tasks? That becomes very handy when it comes to facing any assignment, and can also be used to share information of the project process to members of a team if working with a group.<br> In <a href="C:\Users\traff\Documents\website\ref_2_trello.jpg" target="_blank">this</a> second picture [3] we can see the project that I undertook as a part of a team to make a text game adventure based on Python coding, so we used Trello to divide the project into smaller parts and to keep track of who was working on what and also adding our python files to the cards so we could integrate all the code together, which it was really helpful.</li>

<li>Also Slack was really useful to maintain contact with the members of my team. Not all of us had exchanged phone numbers, so in order to inform of any changes while we were not together, or to make important decisions that needed to be made as soon as possible, we used this app to do so.
<i>"Slack brings all your communication together. Teamwork in Slack happens in channels – a single place for messaging, tools and files – helping everyone save time and collaborate together."</i> <a href="https://slack.com/intl/en-gb/features" target="_blank">[4]</a> Channels can be divided by team, project, client or whatever else is relevant to the company. Even if you archive or leave a channel, its contents are searchable for future reference. Also you can connect other services or tools (such as Zendesk, Salesforce, JIRA and others) to Slack.</li>
</ul>
Now when it comes to keeping track of code version control we have to talk about Github. For those unaware, version control allows you to keep track of your work and helps you to easily explore the changes you have made, be it data, coding scripts, notes, etc. When saving multiple files, comparing them and sharing them with any collegue it's not easy. <i>"With version control software such as Git, version control is much smoother and easier to implement. Using an online platform like Github to store your files means that you have an online back up of your work, which is beneficial for both you and your collaborators."</i> <a href="https://ourcodingclub.github.io/2017/02/27/git.html" target="_blank">[5]</a>
