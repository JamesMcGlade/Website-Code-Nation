                        <h1>Review the ongoing use of IT tools and change approach as needed – in making your own website, are you happy with the tools you used? E.g. Visual Studio Code, Trello</h1>
                        <h3>>Using Trello</h3>

                        <p>Trello has helped me out a great deal when dividing the different parts of the unit outcomes and then piecing it all together, specially when it comes to the layout of the research part. Having different cards with the different sections made the job of adding all the content into an HTML file much easier.</p>


                        <h3>Using Visual Studio Code</h3>

                        <p>Visual Studio Code was really easy to learn (although to be fair I already tried Atom out, so I wasn't that lost) and very intuitive. It pointed out whenever I had a typing error, apart from having a dictionary of it's own. Really happy with this tool.</p>

                        <h3>Using Adobe Photoshop</h3>

                        <p>I used photoshop to edit some images so they had the same size. I'm quite familiar with Photoshop at this point, as I use it for almost all my Youtube videos.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="box box2">
                        <h1>Describe whether the IT tools selected were appropriate</h1>
                        <h3>Trello</h3>
                        <p>For me Trello was quite useful since I tend to be a little bit disorganised when it comes to tackling a task that requires researching and writing down text. Plus, Trello can save your text without using any USB hardrive, so I could even work from my phone.</p>

                        <h3>Visual Studio Code</h3>

                        <p>Despite being the first time using Visual Studio Code, as I said I learned really quickly most of it's features. No complaints.</p>

                        <h3>#Photoshop</h3>

                        <p>Useful when it came to editing the images in order to make them all the same sizes. Although I only used it when I was at home.</p>

                        <h3>Slack</h3>

                        <p>Really useful to share links of the different resources needed to implement features on CSS</p>

                        <h1>Describe further improvements you can make to your project</h1>
                        <p>The main thing that I would like to improve if I had more time would be the styling of the different sections of the webpage. Adding more images, making the boxes of each topic a more attractive... 
                                Basically working on my CSS skills when the course it's over it's going to be one of my objectives, because I know that if I had more practice and I was more familiar with it I would've done a better job.</p>

                        <h1>Review outcomes to make sure they match requirements and are fit for purpose</h1>
                        <h3>Planning and research</h3>
                        <p>The planning of the whole project was really successful for me. Thanks to the Trello board I divided every single outcome in different cards, used it as a text editor -even using it on my smartphone, which worked wonders- and then just copy paste it into the HTML file.
                        <br>Regarding the research; I have previous experience on doing my own research because I used to do exactly that back when I was studying law in Spain. Thanks to that experience, finding my way around on how to address the outcomes from various sources online and finding ways to implement new features both in HTML and CSS has made me achieve a great groundwork to build this project from.</p>
                        <h3>Working on the webpage</h3>
                        <p>I have to admit that since this was the first time working with CSS I found myself more than once having to research deeper into the features and functions of screen responsiveness. But that never stopped me to try and learn more to understand the issues, even working until late back home. Thankfully I had a good layout idea for the webpage, I learned a lot on my own, and also had the invaluable help of the instructors and my collegues. That made me reac the idea I was looking for.</p>

                    <div class="box box6">
                        <h1>Review the benefits and drawbacks of IT tools and systems used in terms of productivity and eficiency </h1>
                        <h3>Benefits and drawbacks</h3>
                        <p>I really can't find any drawbacks on the tools I used during the process. Most of the problems I encountered were styling related. Trello has been really useful as I said before and I have become to consider it as a must have application to carry out my future projects.
                        <br>Regarding Visual Studio Code it has been really intuitive in order to correct some minor typing mistakes from time to time.
                        </p>
                        <h3>Improving eficiency</h3>
                        <p>I was really fixated on making the index page just the way I wanted, and in consecuence I spent most of my time trying to tweak around it. Maybe next time I use CSS I could try to approach it with a different angle thanks to this experience. I would divide the task again, just like I did with my research, from the most basic layout of each page to the last details of styling every section.

                        <br>Working as a team though I think it could have gone way more smoothly, since we would be able to research the different topics saving more time, transcripting the text into an HTML file and finally using CSS to take care of each page of the site.</p>

                    <div class="box box7">
                        <h1>Describe ways to improve productivity and efciency</h1>
                            <p>This is what I have gathered from previous working experience and from this whole project regarding being more productive and efficient</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>For any queries I may have regarding CSS or HTML I will always consult them on <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/" target="_blank">W3Schools</a>. This site had almost every answer for my bumps along the road.</li>
                                <li>Watch tutorials on Youtube. Watching the whole process of building a webpage can be really handy when coming up with ideas or to make clear a part of the coding process.</li>
                                <li>Don't be reluctant to ask questions. I know for a fact that if it wasn't for the help of my peers and our instructors Sam and Leona I would have spent much more time trying to figure out how to solve whatever inconvenient I faced.
                                </li>
                                <li>Take short breaks from time to time. Being in front of a screen all day is not only tiring but also could inflict stress. Having a few minutes to strech your muscles or rest for a bit will increase your performance.</li>
                            </ul>

                        <h1>Develop solutions to improve own productivity using IT in digital projects</h1>
                        <p>
                                As I have mentioned before, Trello has helped me out a great deal to organise my project and I will definetly use it in the future. You can check out my <a href="https://trello.com/b/YoPaMKz5/assignment" target="_blank">Trello board</a> to see the final product of each and every single step I took during the process.
                                <br>If I had to do it again, I would try to do some more research online like a YouTube tutorial or an Udemy course on web development. I have found some good material that can really step up my HTML and CSS skills.
                                
                                <br>I consider this project as a teamwork effort already since I was able to be successful thanks to the help of my colleagues and instructors, and I also helped my peers when I was able and they requested my help on a subject. We actually shared information via Slack like reference links or solutions to any of our questions regarding HTML and CSS. Regarding we were not in the same team, we were on the same boat, which is to learn as much as possible. And for that I have to be thankful.

                        <h1>How I tested out my project</h1>
                        <p>First of all I did all my research and place it all together in an HTML file. After that when it came to designin the CSS stylesheet I tested the outcomes of the different classes, the boxes, the layout of each image one by one. Saved it and checked it on the Inspect window of my browser to detect any problems I found on the display of the page.
                                When I found what the error was I started tweaking around it until I found the solution. That was my whole process.</p>
