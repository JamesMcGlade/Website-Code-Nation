                        <h1>Legal guidelines and constraints that impact digital projects</h1>

                        So when it comes to legal guidelines and constraints that affect a business that runs digital projects it's very similar to any other company, but with a special emphasis on copyright law (which we will disscuss later on) and data protection, which in Europe is underlined by the GDPR or General Data Protection Regulation.
                        <br>This regulation has been implemented in all local privacy laws across the entire EU and EEA region. It will apply to all companies selling to and storing personal information about citizens in Europe, including companies on other continents.

                    <div class="box box8">
                        <p><h3>GDPR</h3></p>
                        <i><p>"Under the GDPR, individuals have:</p>
                        <ul>

                            <li>The right to access –this means that individuals have the right to request access to their personal data and to ask how their data is used by the company after it has been gathered. The company must provide a copy of the personal data, free of charge and in electronic format if requested.</li>
                            <li>The right to be forgotten – if consumers are no longer customers, or if they withdraw their consent from a company to use their personal data, then they have the right to have their data deleted.</li>
                            <li>The right to data portability – Individuals have a right to transfer their data from one service provider to another. And it must happen in a commonly used and machine readable format.</li>
                            <li>The right to be informed – this covers any gathering of data by companies, and individuals must be informed before data is gathered. Consumers have to opt in for their data to be gathered, and consent must be freely given rather than implied.</li>
                            <li>The right to have information corrected – this ensures that individuals can have their data updated if it is out of date or incomplete or incorrect.</li>
                            <li>The right to restrict processing – Individuals can request that their data is not used for processing. Their record can remain in place, but not be used.</li>
                            <li>The right to object – this includes the right of individuals to stop the processing of their data for direct marketing. There are no exemptions to this rule, and any processing must stop as soon as the request is received. In addition, this right must be made clear to individuals at the very start of any communication.</li>
                            <li>The right to be notified – If there has been a data breach which compromises an individual’s personal data, the individual has a right to be informed within 72 hours of first having become aware of the breach."</i></li>
                        </ul>
                        <br> The GDPR is the EU’s way of giving individuals, prospects, customers, contractors and employees more power over their data and less power to the organizations that collect and use such data for monetary gain.

                        <br> this measures are aimed at a better individual and customer data privacy protection, and making the companies responsible for any missuse of information. Since the user can now withdraw their consent at any given point, this means that companies and online business have to be able to prove that the individual agreed to a certain action. So without the user's unmistakable consent,  data held must have an audit trail that is time stamped and reporting information that details what the contact opted into and how. So this not only affects marketing but also the whole process when handling data, which includes safety procedures and regular protocol.

                        <p>But even though the GDPR it seems heavily restrictive, <i>"it seems that companies who show they value an individual’s privacy (beyond mere legal compliance), who are transparent about how the data is used, who design and implement new and improved ways of managing customer data throughout its life cycle build deeper trust and retain more loyal customers"</i>.<a href="https://eugdpr.org/the-regulation/" target="_blank">[1]</a></p>

                        <h3>Copyright</h3>

                        There are many constraints when it comes to building a webpage, but none is usually more present that the issue of copyright. Copyright is a legal right that protects the use of your work once your idea has been physically expressed. The current copyright legislation in the UK is the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988. 
                        <br>And from each element of your website you need to take into account the fact that they don't fail to comply the aplication of coyright. That includes: 
                        <ul>
                            <li>Website text, which will usually be protected as a literary work or as a collection of literary works.  This protection is available to text – and other kinds of recorded symbolic code – irrespective of literary merit. </li>

                            <li> Hypertext mark-up language (HTML) will incorporate the website text: image sources and positions, page divisions, text characteristics... etc. 
                            <br> The HTML of a website is a derivative work of the text of a website.  Much HTML is standard, and any given page of HTML may not have the requisite originality to be protected separately from the protection afforded to the text itself.  If it does, it will be protected as a literary work.</li>

                            <li>Cascading style sheets (CSS) are largely responsible for the specification of the appearance of a web page.   CSS directives are applied to mark-up by web browsers in the process of rendering a web page.  They influence or determine such matters as the positioning and spacing of elements on the page, the colour of page elements and font type, size and style.</li>

                            <li>Almost all modern websites incorporate software of one kind or another, from simple programs to more complex ones.  Software code proper allows for a greater range of expression than of HTML and CSS - so the regulation of software is more present when it comes to copyright</li>

                            <li>Database software will be protected in the same way as any other software.
                            <br> Databases in the legal sense may be protected by copyright if they are the author's own intellectual creation, except if they are integrated within the software used to set up the page.</li>

                            <li>Logos, illustrations and photographs will usually be protected as original artistic works.</li>

                            <li>Music and video. In copyright terms, music that is streamed or downloaded from a website is a “sound recording”, whilst video is “film”.  Both sound recordings and films are protected by special entreprenerial copyrights.  No originality is required for the protection of the entreprenerial copyrights. <a href="https://seqlegal.com/blog/how-copyright-protects-websites" target="_blank">[2]</a> </li>
                        </ul>
                        A good alternative to the use of elements that may be under the regulation of copyright it's the Copyleft, which is  a free software license requiring copyright authors to permit some of their work to be reproduced.
                        <br> As we have seen with copyright law, authors have complete control over their materials. But with copyleft law, users are permitted to engage in copying and distributing copyrighted materials while authors do have some say in who uses the materials based on their intended use. Copyleft laws have provided users the same rights as copyright authors, so they can copy, modify and distribute the product. <a href="https://www.techopedia.com/definition/3261/copyleft" target="_blank">[3]</a>
